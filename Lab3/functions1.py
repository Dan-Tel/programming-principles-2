# 3. Write a program to solve a classic puzzle: We count 35 heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. How many rabbits and how many chickens do we have? create function: solve(numheads, numlegs):

# 12. Define a functino histogram() that takes a list of integers and prints a histogram to the screen. For example, histogram([4, 9, 7]) should print the following:
# ****
# *********
# *******
def histogram(list):

# 13. Write a program able to play the "Guess the number" - game, where the number to be guessed is randomly chosen between 1 and 20. This is how it should work when run in a terminal:
import random

  name = input()

  print(f"\nWell, {name}, I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.")
